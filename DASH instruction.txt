Instruction for DASH model

Run ‘Master_3D.m’ for simulation. There are four sections in the file. Please run these section in order. 

In the first section, specify the directory of the programme, the name of case folder, and the name of output folder, and the name of input file. 

Then, check the pixel dimension of any cross-section image from the output folder, and specify the following parameters in the second section: 
1) H, the height of image in the number of pixels; 
2) ImageDis, the width of image in the number of pixels; 
3) INum, the number of cross sections;  
4) trimEdge, the number of pixels that have been excluded for generating 3D images.  

Run the thrid section, modelling results can be outputted as .txt file (ASCII or GSLib) in the output folder.

Run the fourth section, fence diagram can be generated in the output folder.
